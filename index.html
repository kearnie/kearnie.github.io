	<h1>Feeding Bot</h1>
	<h2>CMU 16-264 Humanoids (Spring 2017)</h2>
	<p>Team members: Lingdong Huang, Kearnie Lin, Vicki Long, Tatyana Mustakos</p>
	<p>Motivation, Purpose, Idea: Our group decided to experiment with robot feeding, particularly in controlling Baxter to recognize facial features and to subsequently move food to a subject's mouth. This project would be a combination of working with the robot arm, facial recognition, and robot learning. 
	We decided on this theme as an experimental approach between fun and utility; whereas ideally the project could be used to feed a lazy person who refuses to move, it could also be introduced as a more legitimate device to feed the disabled or similarly impaired patients who would normally have trouble eating.
	Being a project which poses an explicit goal of being able to control the robot arm to a target direction (location of food, subject's mouth, etc.), we plan to approach our tasks in simple, smaller tasks and gradually increase the difficulty and variety (i.e. food and utensil variability) over time with each ideal success.</p>
